## Requirements
This code is developed using Pytorch on Linux machine. Full frozen environment can be found in 'environment.yml', note some of these libraries are not necessary to run this code. 

## Training and Evaluation
Please refer to the train.py and eval.py for details on training and evaluating the model. Example usage can also be found in the accompanying bash scripts. Additionally, please refer to 'param/' for optics and sensor specs, and 'utils/edof_reader.py' for data processing. 

## Pre-trained Models and Optimized DOE Designs
Optimzed DOE Designs and pre-trained models are available under 'ckpt/' folder. Please refer to the supplemental documents for fabrication details.
